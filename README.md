# Graduate Statistics Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on performing data analysis using Python to clean, process, and explore datasets related to graduate statistics.  

## Key Components of the Analysis

### 1. Data Preparation
- Imported necessary Python libraries.
- Handled missing values by imputing the mean for `NaN` values.
- Concatenated datasets from 2013 to 2021 into a unified and cleaned DataFrame, `Result_df`.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Utilized visualizations to understand relationships and trends:
  - **Pair plots**, **QQ plots**, and **distribution plots**.
- Analyzed independent variables:
  - Year.
  - Total graduates.
  - Basic monthly income.
  - School type (categorical).

### 3. Regression Analysis
- Applied statistical models to explore relationships between variables.
- Evaluated predictive insights using **residual plots** for model diagnostics.

This project demonstrates expertise in:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and preparing datasets for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Using advanced plots to derive meaningful insights.
- **Statistical Modeling**: Applying regression analysis to uncover patterns and trends in educational data.
